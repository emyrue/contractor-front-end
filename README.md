<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## üíª Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need:

- npm version >= 9

### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder:

- git clone git@github.com:emyrue/contractor-front-end.git

This app involves using a cloudinary account to store profile pictures. The app should work fine without it, but there will be some empty image tags and failed api calls.

You will need a gitignored .env file in the root directory with the following values:
- REACT-APP-CLOUD-NAME
- REACT_APP_UPLOAD_PRESET
- REACT_APP_API_KEY
- REACT_APP_API_SECRET
- REACT_APP_CLOUDINARY_URL
- REACT_APP_API_URL
- REACT_APP_BACKEND_ENDPOINT
The first six values have to do with cloudinary, if you choose to set up an account. Otherwise, fill these values with empty strings so the values do not return as undefined.
The last value is the endpoint used to fetch and post data stored in the back end. Visit <a href="https://github.com/emyrue/contractor_api/">Contractor Connect API</a> to see how to set up the back end.

### Install

Install this project with:

- cd contractor-front-end
- npm install

### Usage

To run the project, execute the following command:

- npm start

### Run tests

Tests are not yet in place. Check back for updates.
